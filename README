Portable Mode
=============

Create a folder named "Data" in the same folder as the executable
(the application bundle if using Mac OS X) to run this program from a
USB drive. Simply rename or delete the "Data" folder if you later decide
you want it to start storing its settings and related files on the host
computer.

If you have already been using NovProg and would like to migrate its
files to a USB drive, you will need to copy the "Novels" folder into the
newly created "Data" folder. The "Novels" folder is located in one of the
following places:

  Linux:
    ~/.local/share/data/GottCode/NovProg

  Mac OS X:
    ~/Library/Application Support/GottCode/NovProg

  Windows:
    %APPDATA%\GottCode\NovProg
