  <summary>Wordcount graphing program</summary>
  <description>
    <p>NovProg is a tool to graph your progress in writing a novel. You enter your wordcount and it updates a graph showing you how much progress you have made. It also shows you how far you are through your daily goal, and your total goal. Mousing over a bar in the graph will show a tooltip with that dayâ€™s wordcount.</p>
