"NovProg is a tool to graph your progress in writing a novel. You enter your "
"wordcount and it updates a graph showing you how much progress you have "
"made. It also shows you how far you are through your daily goal, and your "
"total goal. Mousing over a bar in the graph will show a tooltip with that "
"dayâ€™s wordcount."
